# Status

Running status of the Dream multi-role build programme. Updated at the end of
every milestone with what shipped, what was measured, what is next, and what
is blocked.

## M1 — Reminders reach the model — SHIPPED

**What shipped.** The agent turn now searches scheduled reminders with the
user's query, includes anything due soon (overdue, or due within 7 days)
regardless of the query, and renders the chosen reminders into a labelled
Persian section of the system prompt with their stored Jalali dates. The
section shares the existing `DREAM_MEMORY_BLOCK_CHAR_LIMIT` budget and is
fitted *after* memories, so reminders can never crowd memories out; it is
omitted entirely when nothing qualifies, leaving the prompt byte-for-byte as
before. New code: `prompt_reminders()` in `dream/reminders.py` (selection and
ranking) and `Dream._reminder_block()` plus prompt constants in
`dream/agent.py`.

**What was measured.**

- `grep -c -i remind dream/agent.py` → `0` (the measured M1 problem: the model
  never saw reminders).
- Full suite before: `384 passed in 10.65s`; ruff `All checks passed!`.
- Full suite after: `395 passed in 9.89s` (+11 new tests); with `-W error`:
  `395 passed in 9.99s`, zero warnings.
- Acceptance demo (scripted backend, no network): the Persian oil question
  puts the stored date `1405-12-01` and the reminder text in the system
  prompt; a question with no reminder sends no reminder section; a store with
  no reminders adds zero prompt overhead.
- Break-and-restore: with the reminder wiring disconnected, 4 of the new
  integration tests failed (including the oil acceptance test); restored, all
  11 pass.

**What is next.** M2 — non-blocking model calls: extraction must stop blocking
the reply, add retry with backoff on rate limits, and surface a clear message
when a call is abandoned.

**What is blocked.** Nothing.

## Planned milestones

M1 reminders reach the model (shipped) → M2 non-blocking model calls → M3
natural Persian dates → M4 memory provider interface → M5 Telegram → M6 real
tool layer → M7 skills → M8 locale separation → next three proposed with
measurements.
